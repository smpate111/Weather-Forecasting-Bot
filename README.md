# Predicting-Weather-in-Multiple-Cities
This is my on-going project that I am currently working on. The purpose of this project is for me to predict if it will rain in Phoenix, Arizona using data collected from various sensors and various machine learning algorithms to analyze which one is the best. I am currently using an API from [Tomorrow.io] (https://docs.tomorrow.io/reference/welcome) to currently collect the data. Future project ideas to further expand this project are:
- Using personal equipment (Arduino/Raspberry Pi) to collect the data.
- Creating a robot to perform a task based on whether it will rain today or not.
